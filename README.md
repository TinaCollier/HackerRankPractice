## My hackerrank practice solutions

I've been practicing solving problems on HackerRank in preparation of job interviews, as well as, getting more comfortable with JavaScript, Python, and other languages. I used to have to Google search every step of the problem, but I've become more adept at solving the challenges using my own skills. I enjoy solving the challenges and I get excited when I solve a problem, especially if its on the first try. HackerRank makes doing these challenges simple and it has definitely prepared me for my job interviews and coding assessments.
