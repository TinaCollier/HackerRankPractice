# HackerRankPractice
## My hackerrank practice solutions

I've been practicing solving problems on HackerRank in preparation of job interviews, as well as, getting more comfortable with javascript in general. I often use StackOverflow and MDN to help me figure out the solutions, but it's helping me become more comfortable with writing my own code. It's also a much needed break from my MITxPro Bootcamp and Codecademy learning which takes up most of my time.
